## 📂 Projects

### 1. [🚗 Parking Management System - ULACIT](link-to-project)

This is my first programming project, developed with Python to address the inefficient manual parking process at ULACIT. 

The system manages users and vehicles across university parking lots, improving efficiency and user experience. Key features include:

- User registration and vehicle tracking (students, staff, visitors).
- Verification of active enrollment/employment status.
- Parking spot management and time tracking.
- Special control for unregistered visitors.

I developed about 90% of the code, using hardcoded test data for simulation. This project marks the beginning of my journey in software development.

###2. [🍪 Crumbl Cookies Sales System]()  

This is a console-based simulation of a cookie store’s purchasing system, inspired by Crumbl Cookies and built with Java in NetBeans. The system helps users select cookies, enter quantities, and view the total price using an object-oriented approach.

The project was designed to practice and apply Java and OOP fundamentals, including class structure, encapsulation, and method logic.

Key features include:

- Display of available cookies and prices.  
- User-friendly interface for selecting and editing orders.  
- Real-time calculation of total price.  
- Purchase confirmation with order summary.  

I developed around 70% of the system, including most of the logic and structure, while my teammate José contributed the remaining 30%. This project strengthened my understanding of object-oriented programming and marked my first major experience with Java.
