## 📂 Projects

### 1. [🚗 Parking Management System - ULACIT](link-to-project)

This is my first programming project, developed with Python to address the inefficient manual parking process at ULACIT. 

The system manages users and vehicles across university parking lots, improving efficiency and user experience. Key features include:

- User registration and vehicle tracking (students, staff, visitors).
- Verification of active enrollment/employment status.
- Parking spot management and time tracking.
- Special control for unregistered visitors.

I developed about 90% of the code, using hardcoded test data for simulation. This project marks the beginning of my journey in software development.
