## 📂 Projects

### 1. [🚗 Parking Management System - ULACIT](https://github.com/aleNu93/Gestion-Parqueo-Ulacit.git)

This is my first programming project, developed with Python to address the inefficient manual parking process at ULACIT. 

The system manages users and vehicles across university parking lots, improving efficiency and user experience. Key features include:

- User registration and vehicle tracking (students, staff, visitors).
- Verification of active enrollment/employment status.
- Parking spot management and time tracking.
- Special control for unregistered visitors.

I developed about 90% of the code, using hardcoded test data for simulation. This project marks the beginning of my journey in software development.

### 2. [🍪 Crumbl Cookies Sales System](https://github.com/aleNu93/Crumbl_Cookies_Sales_System.git)  

This is a console-based simulation of a cookie store’s purchasing system, inspired by Crumbl Cookies and built with Java in NetBeans. The system helps users select cookies, enter quantities, and view the total price using an object-oriented approach.

The project was designed to practice and apply Java and OOP fundamentals, including class structure, encapsulation, and method logic.

Key features include:

- Display of available cookies and prices.  
- User-friendly interface for selecting and editing orders.  
- Real-time calculation of total price.  
- Purchase confirmation with order summary.  

I developed around 70% of the system, including most of the logic and structure, while my teammate José contributed the remaining 30%. This project strengthened my understanding of object-oriented programming and marked my first major experience with Java.

### 3. [📄 Translation Company Page Management Program](https://github.com/aleNu93/Translation_Company_Page_Management_Program.git)

This is a console-based system for managing the workflow of translation documents in a company, built with **Java** in **NetBeans**. The system uses **Stacks**, **Queues**, and **Lists** to efficiently manage pages, customer requests, and historical records, ensuring a smooth document processing flow.

The project was developed to practice and apply **Java** and **OOP** principles, focusing on data structures such as stacks for page management, queues for customer requests, and lists for tracking used pages.

Key features include:

- Management of translation pages using a stack, with pages being processed and moved to a list.
- Queue-based handling of customer requests, ensuring order fulfillment in the sequence they arrive.
- Historical records that track used pages and served clients.
- An organized document workflow to prevent delays and ensure efficient processing.

I developed approximately **50%** of the system, focusing on the core logic, class design, product management, and purchase simulation, **Main**, and **Cliente** classes, while my teammate **Samuel** contributed the remaining **50%**, particularly the **Hojas** class. This project enhanced my skills in **OOP** and **Java** and provided valuable experience in software design and problem-solving.
