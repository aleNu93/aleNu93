# 🚀 Transitioning from Healthcare to Technology

Welcome to my GitHub. I am a **Computer Engineering professional** with experience in healthcare, public-sector digital transformation, and enterprise IT environments. My work involves the design, implementation, and analysis of software systems, databases, networks, and secure infrastructures.

This repository documents academic and applied projects developed within structured engineering, operational, and enterprise contexts.

## 💡 About Me

Computer Engineering Professional | Enterprise IT | Software, Data, Infrastructure, and Security Systems

I began my professional career in healthcare, accumulating more than seven years of experience in clinical operations and healthcare management roles. During this period, I developed strong capabilities in analytical reasoning, data-driven decision-making, process coordination, and leadership of multidisciplinary teams operating under high-criticality conditions.

I later transitioned into technology-focused roles, applying these competencies to enterprise incident management, public-sector digital transformation initiatives, database systems, networking, and software architecture. My experience includes coordination across technical and non-technical stakeholders, system analysis, implementation support, and validation of technical solutions in regulated environments.

My academic and professional work reflects a structured engineering approach grounded in system reliability, security awareness, and operational accountability.

## 📂 Selected Projects

### 🚗 Parking Management System - ULACIT
Python

A software solution developed to replace a manual university parking control process. The system manages users and vehicles across multiple parking areas, improving operational control and traceability.

Key components include:
- Registration and classification of users and vehicles
- Validation of institutional status
- Parking space allocation and time tracking
- Controlled handling of external visitors

Approximately 90 percent of the system logic was implemented by me using simulated data. This project represents my first complete end-to-end software solution.

### 🍪 Crumbl Cookies Sales System
Java, Object-Oriented Programming

A console-based sales system developed to apply object-oriented principles in a retail simulation context.

Key components include:
- Class-based modular design
- Interactive order management
- Dynamic price calculation and transaction summary

I implemented approximately 70 percent of the system logic and structure, reinforcing object-oriented design and Java fundamentals.

### 📄 Translation Company Page Management Program
Java, Data Structures

A console application designed to simulate document workflow management using stacks, queues, and lists.

Key components include:
- Stack-based page processing
- Queue-based handling of customer requests
- Historical tracking of completed operations

I contributed approximately 50 percent of the implementation, focusing on execution flow, class structure, and system logic.

## 🚧 Ongoing Projects

### JobBridge
A full-stack web platform under development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and React. The system is designed as a structured application supporting role management, workflows, and scalable architecture.

### Mobilux
A mobile application developed in **C# with .NET MAUI**, oriented toward financial tracking of high-value furniture purchases under financing schemes. The application enables structured monitoring of payment schedules, obligations, and outstanding balances.

### Mandatum
A digital delegation platform designed for legal and administrative procedures. The system enables time-bound and revocable delegation of authority without credential sharing, combining biometric authorization with asymmetric cryptography to issue verifiable and auditable digital mandates.
